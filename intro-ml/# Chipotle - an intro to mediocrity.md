# Chipotle - an introduction to mediocrity

Having heard as much positive as negative about the veritable ocean of fastfood available in America, we were rightfully skeptical regarding my first encounter with it. Following these ideas we thought Chipotle would be welcome introduction to american food culture, something which could possibly even rival the kebabs of Copenhagen. However, the only thing we can with absolute surety say about the experience, is that our preliminary feelings were handily confirmed.

Chipotle in Smyrna offers neither culinary revelation nor a glutton's paradise. We purchased three burritos for three people, and were adequately, yet not overwhelmingly so, surprised at the size of these burritos. This was reinforced by the value of the purchase itself, a mere 12.5 dollars for a full-size burrito. The taste, however, was almost surprising in its unsurpisingness. No doubt carnitas and chicken has been seen in both more ample numbers and more with more ample taste, than here. The vegetables, while different from those we are accustomed to in the Kebabs of Copenhagen, were like those long-lost Turkish-Danish cousins, unassuming in their taste. The only two tastes of note were sour cream and guacamole, the former of which is not something you want to be overwhelmed by in a burrito, and the latter of which was present in any way, but in quantity, despite the 2.75 dollars extra we paid to add it to one of our burritos.

Concluding, Chipotle in Smyrna makes an easy-to-beat, but nice-to-have benchmark. It was neither mouth-watering, nor inedible, filling, but not extravagently so. Perhaps it is fortunate that our first culinary experience in America be so unassuming and unsurprising. It is the very meaning of the word, "mid", mediocre, middle-of-the-road... 2.5 out of 5 stars.


# IHOP - A true Breakfast-Lunch

Like the Brits, the Americans have their own full breakfast, the titular item of which is also what truly differentiates it from the British version: Pancakes. Even before making a fateful decision to eat there, at 10PM during an IHOP commercial promising cheap tall stacks, we were intrigued at the concept of a  chain restaurant... specializing in breakfast, truly fascinating to us as Danes, whose usual spartan breakfast of oats, resembles a pauper's meal beside the imperial majesty that is the breakfast sampler platter at IHOP.

At first glance, IHOP very much resembles a traditional American diner. The coffee is cheap and plentiful, the servers attentive, and the food arrives in a very timely manner. The chain nature of IHOP is evident mostly in the overly-colorful menu cards, and the  

# LF Latina Atlanta - Mexico north of the border

Having spent the morning at the temple to american Beureaucracy that is the social security office, trust us when we say, we were having a bad day when we ate at La Fonda Latina. Any negative thoughts about the day melted away, however, when we saw the cozy little restaurant, nestled away along the backroads of Atlanta, just near the Fernbank museum.

Like a little piece of central america, frozen in Amber, La Fonda Latina invites you in with its unassuming, homestyle interior, and the *very* authentic music playing, which provides an appropriate background for the busy kitchen.

We were immediately served a bowl of nachos and salsa, both of which tasted very homemade. The breadsticks of a thousand olive gardens, can barely compare to such an entré. Our food came within moments of ordering it: cubanos, mojo-marianted chicken, and slow-cooked, every dish served with a healthy helping of rice and beans. The chicken was moist and well-marinated, the cubano stocky and bulging with ham, cheese, and pork, and the pork was nigh perfect.The rice and beans ensured, that none of us went from the restaurant anywhere near hungry - as did the chaser of apple empanadas and churros we were then tempted to order.

Stepping back outside, we were almost surprised that we were still in the united states, the restaurant simply oozes latina vibes like that. For the almost three-course central american feast we recieved, we paid but a very reasonable price, not unlike what we would have paid, had we dined at any other medicore fastfood joint or chain restaurant. La fonda Latina was truly a remarkable find, which we did not expect from such an unassuming part of Atlanta. The score of 8.5 stars, is very well deserved. 

# Yellow Dog Eats - Orlando Florida

What was initially meant to be a sideshow - the inevitable lunch before the long haul back from a weekend getaway, proved to be quite surprising in more ways than one.

CJ'd heard of Yellow Dog Eats from a friend of his, studying in Orlando who reccommended it. Google gives the place a cool 4.7 stars out of 300ish reviews, a respectable score, but far from the zounds of reviews you'll typically see in mainstream "Lonely planet" places. Having gotten it reccomended by a local, and due to its very much out-of-the-way placement, we would very much call this place a 'hidden' place. While we cannot guarantee they were so, the clientéle seemed very local as well, the vibe was definitely local (meant in a very positive way).

The Yellow Dog offers you a selection of sandwiches, tacos, fajitas and burgers, most stacked high with roast meats or delicious pulled pork, most of it priced at below 15 dollars - very fairly. Another surprise came with the portion sizes, they were reasonable! Not to say that they were small in any way, our hunger was more than sated going from the restaurant, yet for once it was not a choice between overeating or a doggy bag. 

As for the food itself, the pulled pork burger was as simple as they come: Bun, pulled pork, sauce, slaw on the side. The sandwiches were piled **high** with turkey, bacon, goat cheese and salad. The soft tacos were portioned with pulled pork, beans, cheese and spring onions. Yellow Dog Eats seems to know when to lean to the complex, and when to shut up and enjoy the classics, it is rare when a place can do both. 

We can wholeheartedly reccommend Yellow Dog Eats as as lunch place. It won't blow your socks off or change your life in any way, but it offers a **very** delicious meal at **very** reasonable prices in **very** enjoyable sorroundings. In fact, the qualities of Yellow Dog Eats are exactly what prompted us to include the "hidden gem award" that this place has also earned, well deserved beside its 8.5 star rating.
