Important points to cover:
- Passing images to neural networks
- Methods to reducing size of an image? Interpolation and pooling.
- Why convolution?
- What is convolution?
- What is a CNN? How do we implement convolution in a neural network?
- Different convolution operations? Do I need to talk about stride, dilation and what not? Should I only focus on stuff relevant to here and give resources to extra stuff?
- Other examples of using CNNs?


Exercises to have:
- Experimenting with parameters in a U-Net?

Notes:
- I should probably have a list of resources for current and further reading
